### üåü **Project Description**  
Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges today. Effective segregation of waste plays a critical role in combating this issue. This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automate plastic waste classification into **Organic** and **Recyclable** categories, making waste management more efficient and sustainable. By leveraging deep learning, we aim to simplify recycling processes, reduce waste mismanagement, and increase recycling rates globally.

### üìä **Dataset**  
The **Waste Classification Data** by Sashaank Sekar is used for this project. The dataset contains **25,077 labeled images**, split into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. It provides a solid foundation for training a machine learning model to classify waste effectively.

- **Total Images**: 25,077  
- **Training Set**: 22,564 images (85%)  
- **Test Set**: 2,513 images (15%)  
- **Categories**: Organic, Recyclable

### üß† **Model Architecture**  
The CNN model is designed to classify images of plastic waste into distinct categories. The architecture consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers**: For extracting key features from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensions and enhance computational efficiency.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For final classification.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU (for hidden layers) and Softmax (for output layer).

*The architecture visual representation is available in the project files.*

### üîß **Training**  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Epochs**: Configurable (default: 25)  
- **Batch Size**: Configurable (default: 32)  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied to enhance model performance.
